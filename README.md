# UploadFiles

You should upload test.php and test.html to your server.

Then, edit App.config with the correct values.

Pay Attention !

There is a bug in PHP 5.5. When you upload a ppt file and use finfo to get his extension, PHP crashes.

If you are using a PHP version higher then 5.5, set HasPHPVersionHeigherThen5.5 to true
